## Future Scope
- Here we are using json file of more than 1 lakhs data for reading and storing in sqlite database that is overhead to application as data is static overall so, we can remove that file and only keep Databse.
- making more user friendly UI like adding dark theme.
- we will add more pattern data in app.
